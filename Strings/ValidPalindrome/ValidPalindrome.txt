A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters
and removing all non-alphanumeric characters,
it reads the same forward and backward.
Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

Thoughts before Coding :-

-> remove all the alphanumeric characters in the string.
   NOTE : - Numbers are allowed.
-> covert all char to lowercase.
-> check palindrome.

Solution :-

-> Convert to char array and take one String builder.
-> travers thought the converted array and add to string builder it satisfy all the conditions.
-> again convert string builder to char array using str.getchar.
-> check palindrome using two pointer approach.
