Question :-

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n]
return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3].
 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Thoughts before coding :-

-> Sort the array.
    0,1,3
-> take the sum.
-> something to do with the length of the array.
-> sum - length.

Answer :-

-> The array has a range so since we have the length of the array we can find the sum of n natural numbers using
    n * (n+1)/2.
-> since one number is missing in the range we can just compute the difference between sum of n natural numbers(rangesum)
    and the current arrays sum.

Time Complexity : O(N).
